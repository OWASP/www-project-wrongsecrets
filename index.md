OWASP WrongSecrets is the first Secrets Management-focused vulnerable/p0wnable app! It can be used as a stand-alone game, as part of security trainings, awareness demos, as a test environment for secret detection tools, and bad practice detection tooling. It even has a supporting CTF platform to play the game in a larger group.

Want to give it a shot? Go to [our Heroku demo environment](https://wrongsecrets.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

WrongSecrets is based on Java, Docker, Terraform, and a bit of scripting fun. It contains more than 25 exercises with various wrongly stored or misconfigured secrets - which you need to find. Finding these secrets will

- Help you to look for secrets being misconfigured at your own environment, or target environments for bug bounties.
- Help you to re-evaluate your own secrets management practices as well.
